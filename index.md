This is a short portfolio of some works I’ve done over a past few years. I’m geoscientists & economic analyst by education & [experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itishchenko/ "My LinkedIn"). I love data and enjoy making sense of it; lately, I’ve been working as a data and business analyst. Sometimes I get curious, collect data, and analyze it, then I share my findings. Below is a few examples.
