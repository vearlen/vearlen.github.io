This is a short portfolio of some works I’ve done over a past few years. I’m geoscientists and economic/data analyst by education & experience. I love data and enjoy making sense of it; currently [working](https://www.linkedin.com/in/itishchenko/ "LinkedIn") as a data and business analyst. Sometimes I get curious, collect data, and analyze it, then I share my findings. Below are few examples.
